I enjoy converting complex problems into technology and experiences that are both intuitive and exciting. Over time I've worked on projects in different areas of Computer Science. Most of my endeavors are in C#/.NET, but every now and then I code in TypeScript and Kotlin as well. I'm primarily interested in the Cloud, Distributed Systems, Mobile, Windows and Computer Graphics. My professional hobbies involve Open Source and blogging. Outside of that, I'm also into Filmmaking.
