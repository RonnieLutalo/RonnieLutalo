### Hello World ! 👋🏽
I'm Ronnie, a Technologist and Artist at the core. I enjoy turning complex problems into Technology, Design and Experiences that are both intuitive and exciting. 

Aside from my daily work, I spend time doing research in the areas of Computer Graphics and Computer Systems, how they can help us live better experiences.

I believe when creating a better world through technology & design, possibilities are endless. I believe when creating a better world through technology & design, possibilities are endless. I'm interested and open to talking about Software Engineering for Computer Systems and Computer Graphics Technologies.
