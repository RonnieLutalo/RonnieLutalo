Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ronnie Lutalo, a Software Engineer with both Software Development and Project Management experience as an Individual Contributor and as a Leader respectively. Over time, I've worked on various [projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/projects) involving Web Development and Windows Development using C#, ASP.NET Core, SQL, Entity Framework Core, WPF, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React.js/Next.js. Aside from my engineering work, I occasionally work on projects involving Visual Art & Design.

Outside work, you might find me cheering for my favorite sports team or [blogging](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog) on my personal [website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io) about Software Engineering, Windows Development, Product Development, Web Development or Visual Arts because I generally love sharing with the community.
