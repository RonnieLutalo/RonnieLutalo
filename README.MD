### Hello World ! üëãüèΩ
I'm Ronnie, a Technologist and Artist at the core. I enjoy converting complex problems into Technology, Design and Experiences that are both intuitive and exciting. Over time, I've worked on various projects across a wide range of Technologies, involving development for both Application & System Software. Aside from my daily work, I ocasionally spend time contributing to Open-Source or working on personal Art projects in line with Computer Graphics, Animation, Filmmaking. Tools I'm using include: C#/.NET, JavaScript.

To know what I'm up to lately, some of the latest stuff I'm working on, or how to connect with me, checkout my <a href="https://ronnielutaro.github.io/portfolio/" target="_blank">Official Blog</a> where I also occasionally get to write about Technology, Developer Productivity, Visual Arts.
