### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ronnie. I enjoy converting complex problems into technology and experiences that are both intuitive and exciting. Over time I've worked on Computer Science [projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/projects/) in different industries. Most of my endeavors are in C#/.NET, but every now and then I code in TypeScript as well. I'm interested in the Cloud, Distributed Systems, Windows, Internet Of Things(IoT) and Computer Graphics. My professional hobbies involve contributing to Open-Source and [blogging](https://ronnielutaro.github.io/blog). Outside of that, I'm also into Filmmaking.

To see what I'm working on, here's a [link](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/) to my Personal Website.
