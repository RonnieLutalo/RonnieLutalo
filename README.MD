Driven by desire and curiosity for creating Technology and Experiences that unlock new possibilities. Over time, I've worked on various [projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/work/engineering/) using a wide range of Tools & Technologies like C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, JavaScript/TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, Microsoft Azure (Cloud), WPF, SQL.

When I'm not coding, you can find me [blogging](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog/) on my [Official Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/), shooting adventure and landscapes or working on a Motion Picture.
