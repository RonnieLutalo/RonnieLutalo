Driven by desire and curiosity for creating Technology and Experiences that unlock new possibilities. Over time, I've worked on various [projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/work/engineering/) using a wide range of Tools & Technologies like C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, JavaScript/TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, Microsoft Azure (Cloud), WPF, SQL.

When I'm not coding, you can find me [blogging](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog/) on my [Official Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/), working on Visual Arts or Extended Reality (XR) stuff. I'm always excited to talk about Technology and Visual Arts so feel free to reach out. The best way to reach me is through email (ronnielutaro@gmail.com).
