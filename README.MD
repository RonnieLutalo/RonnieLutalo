I'm Ronnie, a Technologist and Artist at the core. I enjoy converting complex problems into Technology, Design and Experiences that are both intuitive and exciting. Over time, I've worked on various projects across a wide range of Technologies & Visual Arts, involving Software Development, Computer Graphics, Visual Development, Film Direction. Aside from my daily work, I spend time contributing to various Open-Source Technologies and Communities.
