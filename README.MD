Driven by desire and curiosity for creating Technology and Experiences that unlock new possibilities. Over time, I've worked on various [projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/work/engineering/) involving development of Software Systems. I mostly code using C# but also work with a few other Tools like ASP.NET Core, EF Core, WPF, JavaScript/TypeScript, React.js/Next.js, PHP/Laravel, Unity 3D.

When I'm not coding, you can find me [blogging](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog/) or working on Visual Arts (2D/3D Computer Graphics). I'm always excited to talk about Technology and Visual Arts so feel free to reach out. The best way to reach me is through email (ronnielutaro@gmail.com). Want to see some of my recent work?
