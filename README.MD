Driven by desire and constant curiosity for creating end to end experiences that truly enhance humanity, bring joy to the world and unlock new possibilities.

I mostly code using C# but every now and then use JavaScript/TypeScript. Aside from that, I use several other tools including ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, React.js, Microsoft Azure, SQL, WPF, MAUI. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me working on Computer Graphics or my [Official Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog/) where I get to write about stuff I'm working on while sharing my lessons along the way. I also write about [Personal Projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/projects/), Product Development, Software Engineering and Computer Graphics. The best way to reach me is through email at ronnielutaro@gmail.com and I'm always excited to talk about Technology, Engineering & Computer Graphics in general so feel free to reach out.
