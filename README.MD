Driven by desire and curiosity for creating Technology and Experiences that unlock new possibilities. Over time, I've worked on various [projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/work/engineering/) using a wide range of Tools & Technologies like C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, JavaScript/TypeScript, React.js, Microsoft Azure (Cloud), WPF, SQL, Unity 3D, Unreal Engine.

When I'm not coding, you can find me [blogging](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog/) on my [Official Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/), working on 3D Art or a Motion Picture. I'm always excited to share and talk about Technology Development or Motion Picture Arts. The best way to reach me is through email at ronnielutaro@gmail.com
