Passionate about Technology and Art. I enjoy converting complex problems into technology and experiences that are both intuitive and exciting. Over time, I've worked on various projects involving Application & System Software development. Aside from my daily work, I occasionally spend time contributing to Open-Source or working on Hobby projects in line with Computer Graphics.
