### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ronnie, a Software Engineer from Kampala, Uganda. I mostly work on Backend Services and the Cloud. Driven by a desire and constant curiosity about creating great products that fully empower the user from end to end, I believe great products that truly enhance humanity and bring joy to the world unlock many new possibilities.

I mostly code using C# but every now and then use JavaScript on client applications. Aside from that, I use several other tools including ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, React.js, Microsoft Azure, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Docker, Xamarin, WPF.

Occasionally I write on my [Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/) about [Personal Projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/projects/), Product Development, Software Engineering and Computer Graphics. The best way to reach me is through email: ronnielutaro@gmail.com
