### Hello World ! 👋🏽
I'm Ronnie, a Technologist and Artist at the core. I enjoy converting complex problems into Technology and Experiences that are both intuitive and exciting. Aside from my daily work, I ocasionally spend time working on personal Art projects in line with Computer Graphics, Animation, Filmmaking.

To know what I'm up to lately, some of the latest stuff I'm working on, or how to connect with me, checkout my <a href="https://ronnielutaro.github.io/portfolio/" target="_blank">Official Blog</a> where I also occasionally get to write about Technology, Developer Productivity, Visual Arts.
