Driven by desire and curiosity for creating Products and Experiences that unlock new possibilities. Over time, I've worked on various projects across a wide range of Technologies involving C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, JavaScript/TypeScript, React.js, WPF, SQL and Microsoft Azure (Cloud).

When I'm not coding, you can find me working on Screen Writing, Production Design, Creative Direction, Visual Effects (VFX) for Film or blogging on my [Official Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog/) about stuff I'm working on while sharing my lessons along the way. I'm always excited to talk about Engineering, Product Development and Filmmaking in general so feel free to reach out. The best way to reach me is through email at ronnielutaro@gmail.com
