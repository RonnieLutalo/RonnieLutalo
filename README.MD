Driven by desire and constant curiosity for creating great products and experiences that unlock new possibilities and bring joy to the world.

When I'm not coding, you can find me working on Computer Graphics or my [Official Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog/) where I get to write about stuff I'm working on while sharing my lessons along the way. I also write about Product Development, Software Engineering and Computer Graphics. The best way to reach me is through email at ronnielutaro@gmail.com and I'm always excited to talk about Technology, Engineering & Computer Graphics in general so feel free to reach out.
