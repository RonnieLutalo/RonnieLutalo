I mostly code in C# and JavaScript/TypeScript with experience using tools such as ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, React.js, WPF, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL and Microsoft Azure.

When I'm not coding, you can find me working on Computer Graphics/Visual Effects(VFX) for Film or writing on my [Official Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog/) about stuff I'm working on while sharing my lessons along the way. The best way to reach me is through email at ronnielutaro@gmail.com and I'm always excited to talk about Engineering and Visual Arts in general so feel free to reach out.
