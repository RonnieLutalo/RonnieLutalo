### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ronnie, a Software Engineer based in Uganda. Most of my endeavors are in C#, but every now and then I code in TypeScript/JavaScript as well. I'm primarily focused on Backend Services, Distributed Systems and the Cloud. My professional hobbies involve contributing to Open Source and [blogging](https://ronnielutaro.github.io/blog). I as well manage and lead an Open Source .NET/C# engineering community in Kampala under [O.S.C.A Kampala](https://github.com/OSCA-Kampala-Chapter). Outside of that, I enjoy doing Art during my spare time.

Other tools & technologies I use include; ASP.NET Core, React.js, Microsoft Azure, Docker, MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL.

I occasionally write on my [Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/) about [personal projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/projects/), what I'm working on, and also share some of my lessons along the way. The best way to reach me is through email: ronnielutaro@gmail.com
