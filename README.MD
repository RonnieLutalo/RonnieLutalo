### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ronnie, a Software Engineer from Kampala, Uganda. Most of my endeavors are in C#, but every now and then I code in JavaScript as well. I'm primarily focused on Backend Services, Distributed Systems and the Cloud. My professional hobbies involve contributing to Open Source and [Writing](https://ronnielutaro.github.io/blog). I as well lead & organize an Open Source .NET/C# community in Kampala under [O.S.C.A Kampala](https://github.com/OSCA-Kampala-Chapter). Outside of that, I enjoy working on Computer Graphics (CG) during my spare time.

Other tools & technologies I mostly use include: ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, Xamarin, React.js, Microsoft Azure, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS.

I occasionally write on my [Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/) about [Personal Projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/projects/), Product Development, Software Engineering and Computer Graphics. The best way to reach me is through email: ronnielutaro@gmail.com
