### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ronnie, a Software Engineer based in Uganda. Most of my endeavors are in C#, but every now and then I code in TypeScript/JavaScript as well. I'm primarily interested in Distributed Systems and the Cloud. My professional hobbies involve contributing to Open-Source and [blogging](https://ronnielutaro.github.io/blog). I currently as well lead and run a .NET/C# Developer [community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/D8MPoXMBDvj9c9MLfoxOnL) in Kampala under [O.S.C.A Kampala](https://oscakampala.github.io). Outside of that, in my spare time I enjoy doing Art.

Other technologies I work with include: ASP.NET Core, SQL, React.js.

I occasionally write on my [Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/) to share about my [personal projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/projects/), what I'm working on, and also also my lessons along the way.
