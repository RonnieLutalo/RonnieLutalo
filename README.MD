### Hello World ! üëãüèΩ
I'm Ronnie, a Technologist and Artist at the core. I enjoy converting complex problems into Technology, Design and Experiences that are both intuitive and exciting. Over time, I've worked on various projects across a wide range of Technologies & Visual Arts, involving Software Development and Computer Graphics (CGI), had various leadership and project management roles whose experiences serve me as a driver towards developing & improving products & experiences while exploring new or unknown areas.

Some of the Tools and Technologies I'm using include: C#/ASP.NET, JavaScript/React.js, Autodesk Maya, Adobe Creative Cloud (Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects)

I'm open to talking about Software Engineering, Computer Graphics (CGI), and Visual Arts.
