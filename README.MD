Driven by desire and curiosity for creating Technology and Experiences that unlock new possibilities. Over time I've worked on various [projects](http://localhost:3000/) involving Software Engineering, Design, Computer Graphics (2D/3D). Most people believe Art and Science are separate fields. Of which that's academically correct but I personally believe everything is connected to everything else. Art & Science have no reason to be disconnected and that's exactly how I view the world and approach life. I mostly code using C# but also work with a few other Tools like ASP.NET Core, SQL, Entity Framework Core, WPF, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React.js/Next.js, Unity 3D Engine. 

Outside all that, you can find me [blogging](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/) or cheering my favorite sports team. I'm always excited to talk about Technology and Visual Arts so feel free to reach out anytime. The best way to reach me is through email - ronnielutaro@gmail.com.
