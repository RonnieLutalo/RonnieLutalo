### Hello World ! üëãüèΩ
I'm Ronnie, a Technologist and Artist at the core. I enjoy converting complex problems into Technology, Design and Experiences that are both intuitive and exciting. Over time, I've worked on various projects across a wide range of Technologies & Visual Arts, involving Web App development, Mobile development, 3D Computer Graphics, had various leadership and project management roles whose experiences serve me as a driver towards developing & improving products & experiences while exploring new or unknown areas. Aside from my daily work, I spend time contributing to various Open-Source projects and Communities.

I'm open to talking about Software Engineering, Computer Graphics(CG), and Visual Arts. To know what I'm up to lately, some of the latest stuff I'm working on, or how to connect with me, checkout my <a href="https://ronnielutaro.github.io/portfolio/" target="_blank">Official Website</a>.
