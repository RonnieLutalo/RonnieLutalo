Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ronnie Lutalo, a Software Engineer that enjoys building great Products from end to end. I have experience with Software Development and Project Management both as a Leader and as an Individual Contributor. Over time, I've worked on various [projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/projects) involving Web Development and Windows Development using C#, ASP.NET Core, SQL, Entity Framework Core, WPF, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React.js/Next.js. Aside from my engineering work, I occasionally work on projects involving Visual Art & Design.

Outside work, you might find me cheering for my favorite sports team or blogging on my personal website about Software Engineering, Windows Development, Product Development or Web Development because I love sharing what I've learnt along the way with the community. The best way to reach me is through email - ronnielutaro@gmail.com. Want to explore stuff I've been working on? Check out [ronnielutalo.github.io/projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/projects)
