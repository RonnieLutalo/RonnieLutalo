Driven by desire and curiosity for creating great Products and Experiences that unlock new possibilities. Over time I've worked on various [projects](http://ronnielutalo.github.io/) involving Software Engineering and Design. Most people believe Art and Science are separate fields, which is academically correct, but personally, I believe Art & Science have no reason to be disconnected and that's exactly how I view the world and approach life. I mostly code using C# but also work with a few other Tools like ASP.NET Core, SQL, Entity Framework Core, WPF, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React.js/Next.js. 

Outside work, you might find me cheering my favorite sports team. I'm always excited to talk about Design, Product, and Technology so feel free to reach out anytime. The best way to reach me is through email - ronnielutaro@gmail.com. Want to explore some of my recent work? Check out [ronnielutalo.github.io](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/)
