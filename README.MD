I enjoy converting complex problems into technology and experiences that are both intuitive and exciting. Over time, I've worked on various projects involving Cloud Applications, Mobile Applications. Aside from my daily work, I occasionally spend time contributing to Open-Source or working on Hobby projects in line with 2D/3D Computer Graphics & Windows Development. Tools: C#/.NET, JavaScript/TypeScript, Kotlin
