Driven by a desire and constant curiosity about creating great products from end to end, I believe products that truly enhance humanity and bring joy to the world unlock many new possibilities.

I mostly code using C# but every now and then use JavaScript/TypeScript. Aside from that, I use several other tools including ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, React.js, Microsoft Azure, SQL, WPF, MAUI. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me working on Computer Graphics or writing on my [personal website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/). The best way to reach me is through email at ronnielutaro@gmail.com and I'm always excited to talk about Technology, Engineering & Computer Graphics in general so feel free to reach out.
