### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ronnie, a Software Engineer based in Uganda, currently building technology and experiences for humans. I enjoy converting complex problems into technology and experiences that are both intuitive and exciting. Over time I've worked on [projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/projects/) in different areas of Computer Science. Most of my endeavors are in C#/.NET, but every now and then I code in TypeScript/JavaScript as well. I'm primarily focused on Cloud and Distributed Systems. My professional hobbies involve contributing to Open-Source and [blogging](https://ronnielutaro.github.io/blog). Outside of that, I'm also into Filmmaking.

Other technologies I work with include: Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, React.js, Android

To see what I'm working on, here's a [link](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/) to my Personal Website.
