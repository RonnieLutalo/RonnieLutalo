### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ronnie, a Software Engineer from Kampala, Uganda. I mostly work on Backend Services and the Cloud. Driven by a desire and constant curiosity about creating great products that fully empower the user from end to end, I believe great products that truly enhance humanity and bring joy to the world unlock many new possibilities.

I mostly code using C# but every now and then use JavaScript on client-side. Aside from that, I use several other tools including ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, React.js, Microsoft Azure, SQL, WPF, Xamarin.

I enjoy writing about [personal projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/projects/) and stuff I'm working on at my [personal website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/). The best way to reach me is through email at ronnielutaro@gmail.com and I'm always excited to talk about Technology & Engineering in general so feel free to reach out.
