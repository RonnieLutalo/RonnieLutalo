Driven by desire and curiosity for creating Products and Experiences that unlock new possibilities. Over time, I've worked on various projects across a wide range of Technologies involving C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, JavaScript/TypeScript, React.js, WPF, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL and Microsoft Azure (Cloud).

When I'm not coding, you can find me working on Computer Graphics/Visual Effects(VFX) for Film or writing on my [Official Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog/) about stuff I'm working on while sharing my lessons along the way. The best way to reach me is through email at ronnielutaro@gmail.com and I'm always excited to talk about Engineering and Visual Arts in general so feel free to reach out.
