### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ronnie, a Software Engineer from Kampala, Uganda. Currently, I mostly work on Backend Services, Distributed Systems and the Cloud. Driven by a desire and constant curiosity about creating great products that fully empower the user from end to end, I often find myself working on Product Design and Frontend development from time to time. I believe great products that truly enhance humanity and bring joy to the world unlock many new possibilities. Outside that, I enjoy working on Computer Graphics (CG) involving 3D Art and Digital Design during my spare time.

I mostly code using C# and .NET but every now and then, I code in JavaScript as well. I work with a number of several other tools including ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, Xamarin, React.js, Microsoft Azure, PostgreSQL, Docker.

Occasionally I write on my [Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/) about [Personal Projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/projects/), Product Development, Software Engineering and Computer Graphics. The best way to reach me is through email: ronnielutaro@gmail.com
