### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ronnie, a Software Engineer from Kampala, Uganda. Currently, I mostly work on Backend Services, Distributed Systems and the Cloud. Driven by a constant desire and curiosity for creating great products, I often find myself working on Product Design and Frontend development as well. I believe in creating great products that truly enhance humanity and bring joy to the world because this unlocks many new possibilies. Outside all that, I enjoy working on 3D Art and Digital Design during my spare time.

I mostly code using C# and .NET but every now and then, I code in JavaScript as well. I work with a number of several other tools including ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, Xamarin, React.js, Microsoft Azure, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS.

I occasionally write on my [Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/) about [Personal Projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/projects/), Product Development, Software Engineering and Computer Graphics. The best way to reach me is through email: ronnielutaro@gmail.com
