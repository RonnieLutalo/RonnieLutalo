Driven by desire and curiosity for creating Products and Experiences that unlock new possibilities. Over time, I've worked on various projects across a wide range of Technologies involving C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, JavaScript/TypeScript, React.js, WPF, SQL and Microsoft Azure (Cloud).

When I'm not coding, you can find me working on personal Film projects or writing on my [Official Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog/) about stuff I'm working on while sharing my lessons along the way. I'm always excited to talk about Engineering and Visual Arts in general so feel free to reach out. The best way to reach me is through email at ronnielutaro@gmail.com
