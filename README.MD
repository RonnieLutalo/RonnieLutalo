### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ronnie, a Software Engineer based in Uganda, currently building technology and experiences for humans. I enjoy converting complex problems into technology and experiences that are both intuitive and exciting. Over time I've worked on Software for Tech products. Most of my endeavors are in C#, but every now and then I code in TypeScript/JavaScript as well. I'm primarily interested in Distributed Systems and the Cloud. My professional hobbies involve contributing to Open-Source and [blogging](https://ronnielutaro.github.io/blog). I currently as well lead and run a .NET/C# Developer [community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/D8MPoXMBDvj9c9MLfoxOnL) in Kampala under [O.S.C.A Kampala](https://oscakampala.github.io). Outside of that, I'm also into Art. In my spare time I enjoy dancing.

Other technologies I work with include: ASP.NET Core, WPF, React.js.

To see what I'm working on, here's a [link](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/) to my Personal Website where I write occasionally and also get to share my lessons along the way. I also write about my [personal projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/projects/). Most of them are solutions I created to solve a particular problem I was personally facing.
