Driven by desire and curiosity for creating Products and Experiences that unlock new possibilities. Over time, I've worked on various projects across a wide range of Technologies involving C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, JavaScript/TypeScript, React.js, WPF, SQL and Microsoft Azure (Cloud).

When I'm not coding, you can find me blogging on my [Official Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog/) about [personal projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/work) or working on Creative Direction and Visual Effects (VFX) for Film. I'm always excited to talk about Software Engineering, Product Development and Filmmaking while sharing some lessons along the way so feel free to reach out.
