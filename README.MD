### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ronnie, a Software Engineer based in Uganda, currently building technology and experiences for humans. I enjoy converting complex problems into technology and experiences that are both intuitive and exciting. Over time I've worked on Software in different areas of Computer Science. Most of my endeavors are in C#, but every now and then I code in TypeScript/JavaScript as well. I'm primarily interested in Distributed Systems and the Cloud. My professional hobbies involve contributing to Open-Source and [blogging](https://ronnielutaro.github.io/blog). Outside of that, I'm also into Filmmaking.

Other technologies I work with include: ASP.NET Core, WPF, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, React.js, Android, Azure DevOps, Microsoft Azure

To see what I'm working on, here's a [link](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/) to my Personal Website.
