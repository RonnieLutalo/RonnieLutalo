Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ronnie Lutalo, a Software Engineer from Kampala - Uganda with both Engineering and Project Management experience as a Leader and as an Individual Contributor. Over time, I've worked on various [projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/projects) involving development of Backend Services, Windows Applications and Full Stack Web Applications. I mostly code using C# but also use Tools like ASP.NET Core, SQL, Entity Framework Core, WPF, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React.js/Next.js.

Currently working on both commercial and Open Source Technology. I enjoy building great Products from end to end. Also an Open Source enthusiast & Technical Lead at [Open Source Community Africa (OSCA) - Kampala](https://github.com/OSCA-Kampala-Chapter) where we are changing the narrative from having Ugandans not only as users of technology but also as contributors. Occasionally, I also work as a Consultant at [United Nations Women](https://www.unwomen.org/en) with other experienced professionals to share Technical knowledge, experience and Mentorship for the African Girls Can Code Initiative([AGCCI](https://africa.unwomen.org/en/stories/news/2022/05/african-girls-can-code-initiative-second-phase-launched-in-tanzania)) aimed at empowering young girls across Africa to become computer programmers, creators and designers.

Outside work, you might find me cheering my favorite sports team. I'm always excited to talk about Software Engineering, Windows Development, Product Development, Web Development, and Technology in general so feel free to reach out anytime.
